TODO:

 > Generalised to:
    (a) RSCF
    (b) GSCF 
 
 > Reduced density matrices: 
    (a) 1-RDM
    (b) 2-RDM
 
 > Write better test functions

 > In the longer term:
    (a) How do we want to use these matrix elements?
    (b) What is the best format for excitations?
    (c) Interface with integral library for on-the-fly AO integrals
    (d) Only compute occupied/virtual indices in ao2mo transform
